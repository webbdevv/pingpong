  First attempt at creating a ranking page using express, mongoDB, and more to update ranks with accordance to matches created by various players.
  Most functionality is finished, with exception of users. I couldn't figure out how to use passport to correctly authenticate users, it may also be a problem with decrypting hashed passwords.
  Regardless, because of my lack of Javascript skills, this quickly became a incredibly frustrating challenge to debug. As such, I have sidelined this project to study up more on my programming skills.
  
  Issues
  #1 Templates may not render properly in browsers other than chrome (relatively simple to fix)
  #2 User authentication not working
  #3 General stylistic problems need touching up on
  
  Not implemented
  #1 Flowing rank page (currently you can look at the player list to find each rank but this is not sorted)
  #2 Admin user (Not exactly sure how to do this)
  #3 Deploy to Heroku or some other hosting site
